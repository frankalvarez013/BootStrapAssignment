        <p class="lead">Welcome to my Home page. I am a full time student as CSULB. I am a sophmore getting my bachelors degree in computer science. I initially wanted to become a writer but I noticed the possibilities of becoming a successful writer were slim to none, and that the job market is not amazing. I then wanted to become an animator, however due to the fact that I did not want my favorite hobby to become an annoying job that would kill my joy, I decided not to. Then I discovered programming, it reminded me of writing a book, and it allowed my creative side to leap as much as it could. I have a cat named JoJo and he is an allright guy. I do not plan to get a minor currently, I just want to focus on my main studies.</p>
